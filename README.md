A simple dice game that I wrote today instead
of studying for finals. This has always been
a game that me & my family played during the
holidays, so I'm glad that I was able to squeeze
it into the computer (beep boop *other various computer
noises*).

Very bear bones, you can play a simple version
for 3 players by running the main file, but you
can change the player count by changing
the value from 3 to whatever you want (as long
as you have more than 2 players!). You can also change the
type of game (the basic Game from the materials folder simply
plays a game automatically, only returning the winner... or you can play a 
SCI-FI twist with "DICE 2077!")

Have fun... I'm going to study now... wait, I can't study,
I have to tell you the rules silly!

DICE RULES:
You have a certain amount of tokens and a certain maximum amount
of dice you can roll a turn. When it's your turn, you roll a dice
for every token you have (up to the maximum amount), and that
determines whether you keep the die, have to give a token
to the person on your left or right, or throw a token into
the center... meaning no one can get it ever again, frown.

Objective: Make everyone else run out of tokens and hold on
to your own. Once everyone's out of token's and you're the
last one standing... you win! Don't worry if you run out
of tokens initially: one unlucky roll from the person to your
left or right and you're back in the game!

Okay now I'm off to study. Have fun!
