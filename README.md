A simple dice game that I wrote today instead
of studying for finals. This has always been
a game that me & my family played during the
holidays, so I'm glad that I was able to squeeze
it into the computer (beep boop *other various computer
noises*).

Very bear bones, you can play a simple version
for 3 players by running the main file, but you
can change the player count by changing
the value from 3 to whatever you want (as long
as you have more than 2 players!)

Have fun... I'm going to study now.
