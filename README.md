A simple dice game that I wrote today instead
of studying for finals. This has always been
a game that me & my family played during the
holidays, so I'm glad that I was able to squeeze
it into the computer (beep boop *other various computer
noises*).

**DICE RULES**

You have a certain amount of tokens and a certain maximum amount
of dice you can roll a turn. When it's your turn, you roll a dice
for every token you have (up to the maximum amount), and that
determines whether you keep the die, have to give a token
to the person on your left or right, or throw a token into
the center... meaning no one can get it ever again, frown. Think
Left-Right-Center but better because I made it.

**OBJECTIVE**

Make everyone else run out of tokens and hold on
to your own. Once everyone's out of token's and you're the
last one standing... you win! Don't worry if you run out
of tokens initially: one unlucky roll from the person to your
left or right and you're back in the game!

**HOW TO PLAY**

You can go into main and play by changing game in the main function
to any game type you want. You can also change the player count
to whatever amount of players you want by changing PLAYER_COUNT (just
as long as it's 2 or more players). 

From there, the world of dice is your oyster. Play with friends by messing
with the StandardGame, beat the computer in DICE 2077, where computers
took over the universe or something, or simulate games using AutomatedGame.
Feel free to dig around the Game class if you want to make some games of
your own!

Have fun... I'm going to study now...
